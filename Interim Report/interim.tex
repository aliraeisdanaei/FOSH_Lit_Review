\section{Introduction}

What was our original project briefly?
What did we learn since our proposal? 

\section{Sections}
Headings and subheadings showing the major divisions of the literature review, methods, and expected results from the application of each method as well as overall.
A brief summary of what will go in each subsection, including the references to be discussed in each subsection of the literature review.
The major references you will rely on.

\section{Appendix A}
Appendix A: the changes you've made to your project 
(e.g., refining RQs, clarifying scope, resolving vagueness, etc) 
according to the comments/feedback you received from your classmates
% Tips: please consider using bullet points to address each group of critiques. If you do not agree to some critiques, feel free to skip.
% Potential format: 
% Critique: "the scope of the project is too broad, ..." 
%                          Solution: "We refined the project scope to only focus on ...."

% Critique: "RQ1 is unclear, ..."
%                          Solution: "We updated RQ1 to be ...."

\section{Appendix B: TODOs}

1. Divide up the reading between all four members
2. Actually do the reading
    Design a literature map
    Summarise briefly about each paper read
3. Summarise all types of hardware found
    ~(personal, scientific, embedded or specialised)
    Collect all licences found for the hardware
4. Find any sellers or distributors of these hardwares.
    Some hardware may not be published scientifically, but they are FOSH
5. Find benchmarks to compare the hardware
6. Find state-of-the-art in FOSH and nonFOSH from each category

Later on we would have to analyse our readings and notes to determine the challenges, and future predictions, ...
