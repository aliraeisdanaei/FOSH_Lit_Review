## First presentation draft

### Add Anticipated Significance

    Why is this important?
    What is the problem definition, what is the novelty results. 
    This should be made explicit. 

### Turn the "Questions" into real Research Questions
    What can be empirically measured?
    What are the questions and what is the methodology for each of the RQs?

### Anticipated Results

    All future tense.
    No assumptions in the results. 
    Should tie with the RQ and methodology a lot more. 

### Fix the Appeal to the Authority

Free and Open Source is good because it gives this benefit to the community. 

Take the inspiration and turn into science.
