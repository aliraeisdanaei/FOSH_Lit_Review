# A Systematic Literature Review of Free and Open Source Hardware

# Keeping Track of Papers
Please label the key of the papers in the citation file ``ref.bib`` with an enumeration for easy tracking. 
Any recursive paper found can be indexed from the original source using an underscore.
Thank you ;-)

# Planning

# Current TODO List

1. Divide up the reading between all four members
2. Actually do the reading
    Design a literature map
    Summarise briefly about each paper read
3. Summarise all types of hardware found
    ~(personal, scientific, embedded or specialised)
4. Find any sellers or distributors of these hardwares.
    Some hardware may not be published scientifically, but they are FOSH
5. Find benchmarks to compare the hardware
6. Find state-of-the-art in FOSH and nonFOSH from each category

Later on we would have to analyse our readings and notes to determine the challenges, and future predictions, ...
or what FOSH needs that is not there ...
