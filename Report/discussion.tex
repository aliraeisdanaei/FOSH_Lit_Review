% Based on the result, Discuss the potential future developments, opportunities, and challenges that FOSH is facing as well as identify the fields where we could focus more attention on FOSH.

As discussed above, FOSH has the potential to positively and significantly impact healthcare in many perspectives. In the future, we believe there will be continued development of affordable and accessible FOSH medical devices, aiming to reduce the cost to meet the needs of low-resource environments. In addition, rigorous quality standards and certification processes for FOSH medical devices will be established, which can further build consumer trust and confidence in these products. Given the operational products such as robot hands or detectors are not fully tested and matured yet, it is necessary for FOSH communities and healthcare professionals to collaborate and to ensure the safety and effectiveness. This will effectively promote the integration of FOSH into healthcare systems.
