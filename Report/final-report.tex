\begin{abstract}
Our project was a systematic literature review of Free and Open Source Hardware (FOSH).
Since starting to look at the literature on this subject, we have learned many things. 

Firstly, the field is relatively new, yet somewhat vast at the same time. 
The types of hardware we are considering were very limited.
There have been two journals that have been started since 2017, and our project will base most of its review. 
This is good news for our project since it means our review is a systematic review of almost \textit{all} the literature on this subject. 

Given the new information, we have refactored and refined some of our research questions. 
Some questions from the proposal may be beyond the scope of a single paper to be answered, so some may be omitted altogether. 

You can see a repository of our project along with a working document \ref{sec:C} that goes over the details
