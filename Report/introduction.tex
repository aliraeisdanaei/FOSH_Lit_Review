\subsection{Background and Motivation}
The free and open source movement is defined by the following four principles:
\begin{quote}
    A program is a free software if the programâ€™s users have the four essential freedoms:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
        \item The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). 
            Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
        \item The freedom to redistribute copies to help your neighbour (freedom 2).
        \item The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). 
            Doing this gives the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
    \end{itemize}
    A program is a free software if it gives users adequately all of these freedoms. Otherwise, it is non-free. 
    While we can distinguish various non-free distribution schemes in terms of how far they fall short of being free, we consider them all equally unethical.
\end{quote} \cite{b0_stallman}.

These four principles have started a movement that has revolutionised intellectual property and specifically technology. 
We have seen the vast social and technical benefits of this movement.
The free and open source movement has democratised access to information and technology: 
any person has access to the basic principles of \cite{b0_stallman} on the best software.
The movement's technical benefit has been the increase of innovation and collaboration. 
It is no wonder when neighbours help each other build, we have software like the Linux Kernel, Mozzila Firefox, and many others. 

These four principles have been applied to other fields than software. 
Similar to the free and open source software (FOSS), free and open source hardware (FOSH) is any piece of information that is needed to exercise the four principles as it applies to hardware. 
These include anything such as design files, blueprints, specifications, documentation, and even software for the building, designing, modifying, distributing, and using hardware. 
A common example of FOSH is \href[]{https://www.arduino.cc/}{Arduino} used for single board microcontrollers in a variety of applications. 

FOSH has been growing in interest over the years. 
This is evident in terms of the increasing number of projects, associations, literature. 
The Open Hardware Association tracks 
2057 
FOSH projects to date \cite{OSH_association_def}.
It also lists multiple journals that have started since 2017.
These include, 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://openhardware.metajnl.com/}{Journal of Open Hardware}
    \item \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/hardwarex}{HardwareX}
    \item \href{https://www.tjoe.org/}{The Journal of Open Engineering}
    \item Computers, Design and Technologies from MDPI
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \href{Computers}{https://www.mdpi.com/journal/computers}
            \item \href{Designs}{https://www.mdpi.com/journal/designs}
            \item \href{Technologies}{https://www.mdpi.com/journal/technologies}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The new development FOSH provides researchers an interesting study on the open source movement outside the common FOSH movement. 
This is the goal of this project. 

\subsection{Research question}

To understand FOSH one needs to understand its various types, scopes and applications.
Therefore, we ask
    RQA: What are the types, scopes, and applications of FOSH?

Secondly, to measure the level of freedom as described by the four principles of \cite{b0_stallman}, we ask
    RQB: What are the licences of the components of FOSH in each type?

Thirdly, we would like to understand the collaboration environments of FOSH.
    RQC: How do the collaborations of FOSH take place?

\subsection{Significance}
The results of this study are significant as they provide insights to understanding the free and open source movement. 
Its results can be used to improve aspects of FOSS or other similar movements both socially and technically. 

Answers to the application of FOSH can determine the success or limitations of the movement.
The information on licencing could provide answers to the importance practitioners have on the principles, as well as how they are packaging their products. 
Understanding collaboration environments is essential to understanding the social aspect of how people exercise the four principles of freedom defined by \cite{b0_stallman}.
