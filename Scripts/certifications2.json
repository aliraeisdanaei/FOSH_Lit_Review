The first is built using a half-bridge inverter and antennas with series-series compensation, while a microcontroller (Teensy 4.1) supplies high-frequency PWM signals. The measurement unit comprises high-speed operational amplifiers and an exclusive OR gate. A resistor was used as a load. As is well known, the maximum power transfer occurs at the resonance frequency, nevertheless, this depends physically on the geometry of the coupling system. Using a 3D-printed displacement system, we created controlled vertical misalignments between the coils, thereby obtaining variations in the resonance frequency of the system and consequently, producing a proportional phase shift between the voltage and current waves of the transmitting antenna. As the experimental results demonstrate, the measurement system is capable of processing and monitoring this high-frequency phase shift and subsequently used it as a control variable in a proportional-integral controller, which adjusts the operation frequency of the system and brings it back to optimal conditions. This precise yet inexpensive (USD 170) implementation could find its application in EVs and biomedical devices’ efficient wireless chargers.","primaryType":"Education","additionalType":["3D Printing","Electronics"],"projectKeywords":["Magnetic coupling"," misalignment"," phase shift"," resonance frequency"," microcontroller"," wireless power transfer"],"citations":[],"documentationUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5866775","hardwareLicense":"Other","softwareLicense":"MIT","documentationLicense":"Other","certificationDate":"2022-01-21T00:00-05:00"},{"oshwaUid":"DK000001","responsibleParty":"Technical University of Denmark","country":"Denmark","publicContact":"etehw@dtu.dk","projectName":"Low-Cost, Open-Source XYZ Nanopositioner for High-Precision Analytical Applications","projectWebsite":"https://osf.io/d9tws/","projectVersion":"1.0","projectDescription":"We present a design of an open-source XYZ-axis nanopositioning system that provides sub-nanometer resolution, a payload capacity of up to 12 kg (horizontal), compact size, low cost, and easy assembly; furthermore, the system is adjustment-free.

Unfortunately, commercial proprietary vertical racks cost more than all types of conventional PV farm racking solutions. To overcome these cost barriers, this study reports on the development of a new wood-based PV racking design. The open-source design consists of a hinge mechanism, which reduces mechanical loading and enables wood to be used as the main structural material, and is the first of its kind. This open-source vertical wood-based PV rack is (i) constructed from locally accessible (domestic) renewable and sustainable materials, (ii) able to be made with hand tools by the average farmer on site, (iii) possesses a 25-year lifetime to match PV warranties, and (iv) is structurally sound, following Canadian building codes to weather high wind speeds and heavy snow loads. The results showed that the capital cost of the racking system is less expensive than the commercial equivalent and all of the previous wood-based rack designs, at a single unit retail cost of CAD 0.21. The racking LCOE is 77% of the cost of an equivalent commercial racking system using retail small-scale component costs, and is 22%, 34%, and 38% less expensive than commercial metal vertical racking, wood fixed tilt racking, and wood seasonal tilt racking costs, respectively. Overall, wooden vertical swinging PV racking provides users with a low-cost, highly available alternative to conventional metal vertical racking, along with a potential increase in energy yield in high wind areas thanks to its unique swinging mechanism.","primaryType":"Science","additionalType":["Agriculture","Electronics","Environmental","Tool","Other"],"projectKeywords":["agrivoltaics"," biomaterials"," open source"," mechanical design"," photovoltaic"," racking"," renewable energy"," solar energy"," wood"],"citations":[],"documentationUrl":"https://osf.io/qd4ca/","hardwareLicense":"CERN-OHL-S-2.0","softwareLicense":"CERN-OHL-S-2.0","documentationLicense":"CERN-OHL-S-2.0","certificationDate":"2023-03-03T00:00-05:00"},{"oshwaUid":"CH000001","responsibleParty":"Urs Gaudenz","country":"Switzerland","publicContact":"info@gaudi.ch","projectName":"Open.Theremin","projectWebsite":"http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenTheremin","projectVersion":"3","projectDescription":"Theremin instrument.","primaryType":"Sound","additionalType":["Electronics"],"projectKeywords":["Arduino Shield","Music","Instrument"],"documentationUrl":"https://github.com/GaudiLabs/OpenTheremin_V3","hardwareLicense":"Other","softwareLicense":"LGPL","documentationLicense":"Other","certificationDate":"2016-10-08T00:00-04:00"},{"oshwaUid":"FR000011","responsibleParty":"TheStaticTurtle","country":"France","publicContact":"tuglersamuel@gmail.com","projectName":"Open433","projectWebsite":"https://github.com/TheStaticTurtle/Open433","projectVersion":"1.0","projectDescription":"This project is an opensource usb 433Mhz rf transmitter / receiver based on an atmega328p the board uses a serial communication with a \"packet\" based system","primaryType":"Home Connection","additionalType":["Electronics","Home Connection"],"projectKeywords":["arduino","rf",""],"citations":[{"url":"https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch","title":"RCSwitch"}],"documentationUrl":"https://github.com/TheStaticTurtle/Open433","hardwareLicense":"CERN","softwareLicense":"GPL","documentationLicense":"CC BY-SA","certificationDate":"2020-06-23T00:00-04:00"},{"oshwaUid":"US001095","responsibleParty":"DeepScience Ltd","country":"United States of America","publicContact":"dwinters@deepscience.ltd","projectName":"OpenAir Cyan","projectWebsite":"https://github.com/openair-collective/openair-cyan","projectVersion":"1.0","projectDescription":"Cyan is a small-scale direct air carbon capture system designed for individual use.

This improved amplifier is now suitable both for the use in introductory courses in biophysics and neurosciences at the undergraduate level and for scientific research. Similar to its predecessor, the OpenPicoAmp-100k is designed using the common lithographic printed circuit board fabrication process and off-the-shelf electronic components. It consists of the high-speed headstage, followed by voltage-gain amplifier with built-in 6-order Bessel filter. The amplifier has a bandwidth of 100 kHz in the presence of 100 pF input membrane capacitance and is capable of measuring ion channel current with amplitudes from sub-pA and up to ±4 nA. At the full bandwidth and with a 1 GΩ transimpedance gain, the amplifier shows 12 pArms noise with an open input and 112 pArms noise in the presence of 100 pF input capacitance, while at the 5 kHz bandwidth (typical in single-channel experiments) noise amounts to 0.45 pArms and 2.11 pArms, respectively. Using an optocoupler circuit producing TTL-controlled current impulses and using 50% threshold analysis we show that at full bandwidth the amplifier has deadtimes of 3.5 µs and 5 µs at signal-to-noise ratios(SNR) of 9 and 1.7, respectively. Near 100% of true current impulses longer than 5 µs and 6.6 µs are detected at these two respective SNRs, while false event detection rate remains acceptably low. The wide bandwidth of the amplifier was confirmed in bilayer experiments with alamethicin, for which open ion channel current events shorter that 10 µs could be resolved.","primaryType":"Science","additionalType":["Education"],"projectKeywords":["voltage-clamp"," temporal resolution"," ion channels"," electronic design"],"citations":[],"documentationUrl":"https://github.com/Shlyonsky/OpenPicoAmp-100k","hardwareLicense":"Other","softwareLicense":"No software","documentationLicense":"CC BY-SA","certificationDate":"2020-02-26T00:00-05:00"},{"oshwaUid":"UK000042","responsibleParty":"OpenScout","country":"United Kingdom","publicContact":"projectopenscout@gmail.com","projectName":"OpenScout","projectWebsite":"https://github.com/cbedio/OpenScout","projectVersion":"0.1.0-alpha","projectDescription":"OpenScout is a low-cost open source hardware and software mobile robot that can be used for both indoor and outdoor tasks, transporting up to 15kg of payload.

POSCAS is an adapted cold-frame that is normally used for gardening in cold climates as it acts as a small greenhouse for agricultural production. POSCAS is designed to test partially transparent solar photovoltaic (PV) modules targeting the agrivoltaic market. The systems are parametric so they can be adapted for any size of PV module and designed to take advantage of distributed manufacturing. In addition, the thickness of the walls, type of wall insulation, possessing a floor or being directly located on the ground, the tilt angle of the module can all eb controlled by a parametric OpenSCAD script. The script outputs a 3-D printable file (STL) so the frame body can be manufactured from any waste plastic using distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM). POSCAS can both function as a traditional cold frame but it can also be automated with a temperature sensor, open source Arduino, fan and/or a motor to control air inflow into the greenhouse box. It can also be coupled to any number of other sensors to automate the care of the plants by controlling irrigation and fertilization. The PV module can be used to power the controls or it can be attached to a microinverter to produce power. POSCAS can be placed in an experimental array for testing, agricultural and power production. POSCAS can be easily adapted for any type of partially transparent PV with thin film or crystalline silicon-based modules.  The percent transparency of the modules can be tested in a bank of POSCASs by varying the thickness of a thin film PV material, the various forms of optical enhancement and anti-reflection coatings or the density of silicon-based cells in the module. For example, they can be used to optimize Heliene greenhouse solar panels for specific crops.  Such Heliene red modules can have different transparencies by adjusting the density of the crystalline-silicon based cells. They are bifacial modules, which contain an energy-producing photovoltaic cells that generates electricity both from the top where the sunlight strikes it and from any reflection coming from underneath, and a red back-sheet. The back sheet transforms the green light spectrum into red before reaching the plants in the POSCAS below, while at the same time reflecting it back to the photovoltaic cell, which turns it into electricity that can be used in the greenhouse. The active materials that are in the back sheet can also be tested by the POSCAS (e.g. testing the density, size and chemical makeup of nanoparticles responsible for the solar light spectral shifting). All of these variables can be used to identify ideal PV designs for a given agricultural crop. This includes experimentally verifying the albedo from the crops and their impact on the different types of partially-transparent bifacial PV modules.","primaryType":"Agriculture","additionalType":["Agriculture"],"projectKeywords":["additive manufacturing; agriculture; agrivoltaic; distributed manufacturing; farming; gardening; open hardware; photovoltaic; recycling; solar energy"],"citations":[],"documentationUrl":"https://osf.io/k6xwv/","hardwareLicense":"CERN-OHL-P-2.0","softwareLicense":"No software","documentationLicense":"CC BY","certificationDate":"2021-11-12T00:00-05:00"},{"oshwaUid":"ES000004","responsibleParty":"Universidad Rey Juan Carlos","country":"Spain","publicContact":"felipe.machado@urjc.es","projectName":"Parametric optical filter stage","projectWebsite":"https://github.com/felipe-m/freecad_filter_stage","projectVersion":"0.1","projectDescription":"Paremetric optical filter stage modeled with Python scripts for FreeCAD. \r\nDimensions of the components depend on parameters that can be modified.\r\nIt has 3 main componets to print: filter holder, belt tensioner and motor holder.\r\nAlternative model in OpenSCAD","primaryType":"Science","additionalType":["3D Printing"],"projectKeywords":["FreeCAD"," Python"," Optical filter stage"," OpenSCAD"," Parametric design"," Laboratory equipment"],"citations":[],"documentationUrl":"https://github.com/felipe-m/freecad_filter_stage","hardwareLicense":"CERN","softwareLicense":"LGPL","documentationLicense":"CC BY","certificationDate":"2019-07-23T00:00-04:00"},{"oshwaUid":"US002005","responsibleParty":"Foundation Devices, Inc.","country":"United States of America","publicContact":"hello@foundationdevices.com","projectName":"Passport","projectWebsite":"https://foundationdevices.com","projectVersion":"1","projectDescription":"Passport is a next-gen Bitcoin hardware wallet that uses a camera to transact via QR codes.","primaryType":"Electronics","additionalType":["Enclosure","Other"],"projectKeywords":["bitcoin"," hardware wallet"],"citations":[],"documentationUrl":"https://docs.foundationdevices.com","hardwareLicense":"CERN","softwareLicense":"GPL","documentationLicense":"CC BY-SA","certificationDate":"2021-06-11T00:00-04:00"},{"oshwaUid":"FR000017","responsibleParty":"Emmanuel Maisonhaute","country":"France","publicContact":"emmanuel.maisonhaute@sorbonne-universite.fr","projectName":"PassStat","projectWebsite":"https://ohwr.org/project/passstat","projectVersion":"1","projectDescription":"A low cost potentiostat circuit to perform electrochemistry experiments with still high performances.

It would be good for detecting when a hand moved nearby, or before a robot smacks into a wall. The sensor also has an ambient light sensor. This sensor is easy to use with any microcontroller that has i2c capability. You can use it with 3.3V or 5V logic with no risk of damage.
