## Report
Due in three weeks

[ ] All of us summarise results of our readings
[ ] Find a script to mine the literature based on our RQs
[ ] Collect the information from the script
-- Next week April 6th. 

The week of April 10th would be our writing period



1. Divide up the reading between all four members
2. Actually do the reading
    Design a literature map
    Summarise briefly about each paper read
3. Summarise all types of hardware found
    ~(personal, scientific, embedded or specialised)
    Collect all licences found for the hardware
4. Find any sellers or distributors of these hardwares.
    Some hardware may not be published scientifically, but they are FOSH
5. Find benchmarks to compare the hardware
6. Find state-of-the-art in FOSH and nonFOSH from each category

Later on we would have to analyse our readings and notes to determine the challenges, and future predictions, ...
or what FOSH needs that is not there ...
