\section{Introduction}
This is a drafting document created for the purpose of writing any ideas down.
This document is only a draft; therefore, it is rough and messy.
However, the full report should evolve out of this document.

\section{Research Questions}
Here are the research questions:

RQ1: What is the state-of-the art FOSH and what are the performance of this best FOSH? How does it compare in terms of performance and other aspects with the non-FOSH state-of-the-art? 

RQ2: What are the main challenges and drawbacks associated with the development, adoption, and sustainability of FOSH?

RQ3: How does non-FOSH compare with FOSH in terms of design and licsensing?

RQ4: To what extent is FOSS more adapted FOSH development, and what are the factors that contribute to any observed differences in their adaptability?

RQ5: What are the potential future developments, opportunities, and challenges that FOSH is facing, and what are the implications of these for the growth and sustainability of the FOSH movement?

\section{Introduction}
We need an introduction to what free and open source is. 
A history of this in the software realm and how this idea is extending to hardware is needed. 

We need to understand what are the values and principles of free and open source, and how they exactly relate to free and open source hardware (FOSH).

An overview of hardware and its difficulties is needed as a good background information.
